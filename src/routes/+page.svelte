    <section>

        <h2>Player Characters</h2>

        <p>
        You take on the role of a <b>player character (PC)</b>. 
        PCs are heroic (or perhaps antiheroic) adventurers
        who brave perilous dangers seeking fame and fortune. 
        Throughout this document, the word <i>you</i> will
        refer primarily to the character you are controlling.

        <br/>
        
        The following are some of the most important traits that define your PC:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Race</b> — your biological or supernatural species.
                Your choice of race will grant you racial <b>features</b>
                based on your physiology and innate magical abilities. 
                It also determines your <b>size</b> and <b>creature types</b>.
                A list of common races and their descriptions
                can be found in Chapter 2: Races.
            </li>
            <li><b>Class</b> — your archetypal role, which will determine core aspects of your gameplay. 
                A list of classes and their descriptions can be found in Chapter 3: Classes. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Level</b> — a number representing how powerful and experienced you are.
                You typically start at level 1, and may eventually reach the maximum level of 10.
                You increase your level by going on adventures and confronting challenges to earn <b>Experience</b>.
            </li>
            <li><b>Attributes</b> — numbers that quantify your strengths and weaknesses.</li>
            <li>Your appearance, personality, motivations, flaws, and other traits as a character within a story.</li>
        </ul>

    </section>

        <h2>Attributes</h2>

        <p>
            Attributes are a set of six fundamental traits which 
            quantify your strengths and weaknesses as an adventurer.
        </p>
        
        <ul>

            <li><b>Strength (STR):</b> Measures physical might and force.</li>
            <li><b>Dexterity (DEX):</b> Measures precision and agility.</li>
            <li><b>Constitution (CON):</b> Measures physical stamina and resilience.</li>
            <li><b>Intelligence (INT):</b> Measures knowledge and memory.</li>
            <li><b>Awareness (AWR):</b> Measures perceptiveness and sharpness of the senses.</li>
            <li><b>Charisma (CHA):</b> Measures confidence and ability to influence others.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>

        Each of your attributes has a numerical value,
        which ranges from 0 (corresponding to around the
        capability of an average non-heroic person) 
        to 4 (representing extraordinary talent).
        A higher attribute increases your chance of a successful outcome
        when performing risky or difficult activities related to it.

        </p>

        <aside>
            <h3>Determining Attributes</h3>
            <p>
                At 1st level, choose two attributes to assign a value of +2,
                and two others to assign a value of +1.
                The remaining two attributes have a value of 0.

                <br/>

                Your attributes improve as you level up,
                as detailed in the <b>Levels & Experience</b> section.
