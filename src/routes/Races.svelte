    <h1>Chapter 2: Races</h1>

    <p>
        This game takes place in a fantasy world where many different intelligent species,
        called <b>races</b>, coexist. Your race determines these aspects of your character:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Anatomy and appearance.</b>
            Your choice of race provides general guidelines
            for your appearance such as your proportions;
            the possible range of colors for things like eyes, skin, fur, or scales;
            whether you have claws, fangs, a tail, or other unusual appendages;
            and any other unique characteristics you might have.
            These descriptions are by no means exhaustive, and you are free to deviate
            from them (within reason, e.g. don't give yourself wings).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Size.</b>
            Size is a keyword that categorizes how much space a creature takes up.
            Most playable races are <b>medium</b>, which is around
            5 to 7 feet tall (approximately the size of an adult human).
            Some races are <b>small</b> (about half as large as a medium creature),
            and some are <b>large</b> (about twice as large).
            Your size is used to determine things like 
            where you're able to fit and whether or not you can grapple someone.
            Some races allow you to choose from two sizes when creating your character.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Creature types.</b>
            Creatures are categorized into types
            based on their general anatomy and supernatural origin.
            With few exceptions, playable races are <b>humanoid</b> â€”
            relatively mundane beings that resemble humans in sapience
            and anatomy (one head, two arms and legs, etc)
            Some races have more than one type, such as <i>fiend humanoid</i>,
            to represent their otherworldly ties.
            Creature types don't have any inherent rules,
            but some abilities only work on certain kinds of creatures.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Racial features.</b>
            Your race grants you a set of <b>core features</b> representing
            special abilities directly tied to your particular physiology
            or inherent supernatural powers. You will also get a set of <b>major features</b>
            that you can choose from at certain levels, representing latent abilities
            that awaken with maturity or experience.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Dragonborn</h2>

        <p>
            <i>Medium or Large dragon humanoid</i>
            <br />
            A dragonborn is the distant descendant of a union between a dragon and a humanoid.
            They share many traits in common with their draconic ancestors: scaly hides; serpentine faces;
            sharp teeth and claws; a tail; and sometimes even small vestigial wings.
        </p>

        <aside>
            <h3>Dragon Lineages</h3>
            <p>
                There are six main lineages of dragons, distinguished by color.
                A dragon's color determines its preferred habitat,
                what it tends to hoard, and most importantly: the type of breath it expels.
                When you create your dragonborn, choose one of these lineages.
                This choice will be used to determine the damage type associated with some of your features,
                and can also help guide your characterization.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Black.</b>
                    Black dragons have a <b>necrotic</b> breath that withers the living and raises the dead.
                    They value hoards of knowledge and secrets over material things,
                    though ancient artifacts and rare tomes do greatly entice them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Blue.</b>
                    Blue dragons belch <b>shocking</b> electricity and their wingbeats spur thunderstorms.
                    They make their lairs near the sea so they may hoard its treasures:
                    coral, shells, pearls, and the cargo of ships.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Gold.</b>
                    Gold dragons fire beams of <b>radiant</b> sunlight as their breath.
                    They favor deserts and similarly hot and barren landscapes.
                    They hoard jewels, glassware, and whatever else glitters brilliantly in the light.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Green.</b>
                    Green dragons exhale a miasma of <b>toxic</b> gas.
                    They dwell in swamps and deep forests, where they tend
                    to gardens of rare flora and fauna as their hoards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Red.</b>
                    Red dragons iconically roast their foes with a breath of <b>burning</b> flames.
                    They inhabit the stony crags of canyons and mountains,
                    sleeping atop massive piles of gold, silver, and other precious metals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>White.</b>
                    White dragons posses a <b>freezing</b> breath, and likewise inhabit frigid climates.
                    They hoard metalwork, usually preferring steel and iron to gold and silver.
                </li>
            </ul>
